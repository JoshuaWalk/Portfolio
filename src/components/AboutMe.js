                <h2> My Programming Experience </h2>
                <p> After realizing college might not be the path for me I started searching for an alternative. 
                I got some advice from friends and family who told me about Web Development Boot-Camps. 
                Those I know who went through these camps had been successful in creating a career for themselves. 
                I talked with a lot of them about it and they encouraged me to go through one. I decided to give it a shot.

                I ended up going to 'Helio Training', a fully immersive web development course in October of 2018. 
                I wasn't completely sure what to expect, but I started really enjoying it. Over the next 3 months I was 
                able to learn a lot about javascript and some of the technologies around it. On the front end I became proficient 
                with React.js and taught myself the basics of Vue.js (probably my favorite front end framework). 
                On the back end I was able to learn about MongoDB and SQL. Although I am more comfortable with the front end of development I enjoy working with both.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                My favorite thing to do with my newfound knowledge is to test myself on websites like codewars.com. 
                I really enjoy finding challenging puzzles, and figuring out how to teach a computer to solve them. 
                It's fun for me to pick apart a problem logically and try to find the most efficiant way to solve that problem.
                <br />

                Although I am still fresh to web development I am proud of myself for being able to make a website! If you asked me last october
                to build you a website I wouldn't even know where to begin. Now I have my own website that I was able to make from scratch. I know it's not much now,
                but I will keep adding to it as I learn to show off what I know. Since my graduation I have been able to take additional courses online. I have taken courses on SQL, Vue.js, and 
                am currently taking a course on Python. I am also looking for a job as a web developer, so if you are looking to hire one 
                or know somebody that does please feel free to send me an email on my contact page!
